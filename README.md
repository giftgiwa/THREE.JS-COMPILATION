# THREE.js-compilation
Here are a bunch of things I'm making/trying out with Three.js.

As of now, I've made:
  (1) an interactive 3D rendering of the Columbia University [crown](https://giftgiwa.github.io/THREE.js-compilation/Crown/)
  (2) a [sphere cluster](https://giftgiwa.github.io/THREE.js-compilation/Sphere/) (WIP) that I plan to use for my personal website.
